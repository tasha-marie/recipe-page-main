## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned about using percentages for widths to keep things more responsive. I had never even considered that the browser is already responsive and we are the ones who mess it up! I also dug deeper into understanding the differences between rem em and relation to pixels. This is helping me create more responsive layouts from the start, without using a ton of media queries. 

### Continued development

Though I did not use it for this project, I am still focusing on learning grid, as well as semantic HTML and how to create responsive sites. 

### Useful resources

- [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://www.kevinpowell.co/courses/) - This helped me understand the reasons behind not using set widths and heights, as well as explained em and rem. I like that it is a drip course that requires you to practice skills before moving on to the next section. 
- [Professional CSS Build a Website From Scratch](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/pro-css/) - Found this one on Frontend Masters and am really digging Kevin Powell and the way that he explains things.
